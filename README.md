# MEAN Stack Othello

This is my implementation of Othello, using a mean stack, scaffolded with yeoman angular-fullstack

## Getting Started

Currently has not been tested on other environments.  

Requires background instance of MongoDB to be running. It should not require a login. The application will automatically create a database called `othello-dev`.  

To see configurations, go to `server/config/environment/development.js`. These are the defaults.

Run `npm install && bower install` to retrieve package dependencies.

To start the server, run `grunt serve` on the root directory.
